Having that said, I do believe I (and probably other Vanhacktoners) would be able to get better results if we got more data.  I've spent most of the time working on building a train dataset the would have relevant information - under my perspective, of course ;-).\n","\n","Thanks for the opportunity of working on this challenge.
